This application was created with the dotnet new console command.

Within this project, we effeciently demonsrate how to integrate 
entity core within even a simple console application. All that
is required to get the initial User database set up is to create
a Models folder, and then create the User.cs file. Afterwards,
we create the Data folder and set up our database configuration within
our ApplicationDbContext, in which we also include Db<User> so that
the User table is inserted into our database. Once you have added
all the necessary packages, do the initial migration with update
the database. You can verify the completion of these tasks by looking
in the Migrations folder and seeing that the User table was created,
and you can check that the database being made on the configuration
function sets up our database within the bin/Debug/netcoreapp3.0
folder.
